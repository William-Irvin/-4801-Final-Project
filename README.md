# -4801-Final-Project

This GitHub is a repo for a meta-analysis of HIV drug resistance between the years of 2010 and 2016, where analysis was done by a Poisson regression for BIOS 4801-RIC F25. 

 

Overall, the main question of this project is how do HIV resistance rates change over time and because of inequality? As HIV medications become more commonplace, it is expected that more mutations would prop up over time due to natural mutation and selection. Additionally, equality often leads to a lack of resources, which can make it hard to consistently get treatment for HIV. It is hypothesized that over time there will be a significant difference in the amount of HIV drug resistance. Additionally, it is predicted that Inequality, as measured by the Palma ratio will have a significant effect on levels of drug resistance in HIV. Methods for analysis of these hypotheses are a poisson of regression utilizing the counts of resistance and people from each study that is weighed so that larger studies do not have a large bias on the results. 

 

Originally, the data sets included in the experiment were Stanford's HIV resistance database, our own World Palmas ratio database, and HIV prevalence. As the hypothesis was focused, the only databases used in analysis were the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and the Palma Ratio Database. The Stanford HIV Resistance Database includes a myriad of studies, where they were analyzing the population, how many people were part of each study, as well as percentage of resistance in respective populations. These levels of resistance were divided into nuclease types, integrase types, and protease types. Additionally, the sum of resistance was also given in the data set. This data was collected from a whole host of smaller studies for the purpose of analyzing long-term trends and meta-analysis. The Palmer Ratio database was found on our own World, which is a public database detailing many social economic trends. This data was collected by a variety of methods; however, in this case it was done by a calculation mathematically of the top 10% income in a country compared to the bottom 40% of income in a country.
